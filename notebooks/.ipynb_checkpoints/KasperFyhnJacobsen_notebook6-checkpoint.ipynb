    "A bit like in my last notebook, I have tried to define a class which makes writing the different scripts with different needs easier - at least to some degree, i.e. I will be using the same class through the different scripts, so I won't have to write it again. Another nifty thing is that I will potentially be able to simply expand the class definition to add on more functionality for later projects."
